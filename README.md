# **Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning**  

This repository provides an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting heart disease based on patient health data. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation of multiple ML models.

---
## **Dataset**  
We use a publicly available heart disease dataset, which contains various health metrics such as:
- Age, Sex, and Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure and Cholesterol Levels
- Fasting Blood Sugar and ECG Results
- Maximum Heart Rate and Exercise-Induced Angina

---
## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
### **Sample Data Visualization**  
Below are some visualizations used in the notebook:

ðŸ“Š **Feature Distributions:** Histograms and boxplots to analyze feature distributions.
ðŸ“ˆ **Correlation Heatmap:** To understand relationships between variables.
âš• **Class Imbalance Check:** To verify the balance between heart disease and non-heart disease cases.


---
## **Machine Learning Models Used**  
The following models are implemented and compared:

âœ… **Logistic Regression**  
âœ… **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
âœ… **Random Forest Classifier**  

Each model undergoes hyperparameter tuning and evaluation.

## **Model Performance**  
| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |
|--------|---------|-----------|--------|
| Logistic Regression | 85% | 84% | 83% |
| KNN | 81% | 79% | 78% |
| Random Forest | 88% | 87% | 86% |

---
## **Usage**  
1. Open `end-to-end-heart-disease.ipynb`
2. Run the EDA cells to visualize data
3. Train different models and evaluate their performance
4. Tune hyperparameters and interpret the results
